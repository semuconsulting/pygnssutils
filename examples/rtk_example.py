PLEASE RESPECT THE TERMS OF USE OF ANY NTRIP CASTER YOU
USE WITH THIS EXAMPLE - INAPPROPRIATE USE CAN RESULT IN
YOUR NTRIP USER ACCOUNT OR IP BEING TEMPORARILY BLOCKED.

This example illustrates how to use the UBXReader and
GNSSNTRIPClient classes to get RTCM3 or SPARTN RTK data
from a designated NTRIP caster/mountpoint and apply it
to an RTK-compatible u-blox GNSS receiver (e.g. ZED-F9P)
connected to a local serial port (USB or UART1).

GNSSNTRIPClient receives RTCM3 or SPARTN data from the NTRIP
caster and outputs it to a message queue. An example
GNSSSkeletonApp class reads data from this queue and sends
it to the receiver, while reading and parsing data from the
receiver and printing it to the terminal.

GNSSNtripClient optionally sends NMEA GGA position sentences
to the caster at a prescribed interval, using either fixed
reference coordinates or live coordinates from the receiver.

NB: Some NTRIP casters may stop sending RTK data after a while
if they're not receiving legitimate NMEA GGA position updates
from the client.
