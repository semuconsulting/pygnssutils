spart_decrypt.py

Illustration of how to read, decrypt and decode the contents
of a binary SPARTN log file e.g. from an Thingstream PointPerfect
SPARTN MQTT or NTRIP service.

NB: decryption requires the key and basedate applicable at the
time the SPARTN log was originally captured.

Usage:

python3 spartn_decrypt.py infile="d9s_spartn_data.bin" key="bc75cdd919406d61c3df9e26c2f7e77a" basedate="2023-9-1-18:0:0"

Run from /examples folder. Can use output from mqtt_spartn_client.py
example.

Configured by default to use d9s_spartn_data.bin sample file.

FYI: SPARTNMessage objects implement a protected attribute `_padding`,
which represents the number of redundant bits added to the payload
content in order to byte-align the payload with the exact number of
bytes specified in the transport layer payload length nData. If the
payload has been successfully decrypted and decoded, the value of
_padding should always be >=0, <=8.
